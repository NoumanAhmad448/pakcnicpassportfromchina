**Assalamu Alaikum!** Sharing a practical **Umrah guide** based on my recent experience. This plan works for travelers from **China** (and can be adapted for **Pakistanis** by changing flight details).

### **📌 *Key Steps for Umrah Visa & Travel***  

1️⃣ **Umrah Visa (90 Days) – Cost: ~60,000 PKR**  
   - Get it through an agent (prices may vary slightly).  
   - **Requirements:**  
     - **Confirmed return flight tickets** (some agents may skip this).  
     - **Saudi phone number & Aqama** (from a friend/relative in KSA).  

2️⃣ **Flight Options (From China Example)**  
   - **Guangzhou → Riyadh (Direct): ~9h**  
     - *Pro Tip:* Book **Riyadh flight first** to secure the visa, then plan onward travel to Jeddah/Mecca.  

3️⃣ **From Riyadh to Mecca**  
   - **Option 1:** Fly to **Jeddah** (closest airport to Mecca).  
   - **Option 2:** Take the **Haramain High-Speed Train** (Jeddah → Mecca, **1h journey**, only **2 stops**).  
     - From **Mecca Train Station → Haram**, take **Bus 7A (8 SAR)**.

### **🏨 *Accommodation Tips***  
- **Cheapest Hotels:** ~70 SAR | **Mid-Range:** Up to 270 SAR  
- **Booking Options:**  
  - **Walk-in** (negotiate on arrival).  
  - **Trip.com** (pre-book for convenience).  
- **Distance:** Most hotels are within walking distance to Haram (some closer than others).  

---

### **✂️ *Haircut After Umrah***  
- **Location:** Near **Abraj Al-Bait (Clock Tower)**, 3rd/4th floor (many barbershops).  
- **Cost:** **10 SAR** (ignore touts, just follow the signs!).  

---

### **🚖 *Transport Tips (China-Specific)***  
- **Guangzhou Airport Transfer:**  
  - **arrive at North Station and exit at East gate or use subway if no luggage).  
  - Otherwise, take a **taxi (打车 dǎ chē)**.

Urdu is 2nd to none in KSA. 
You will find a lot of Indonesian reciting but loud in form of groups. I found it fascinating personally what I thought. 

For safa marwa, you can find a wheel chair service to excort someone who may know and with you or its you.

### **❓ *Did I Miss Anything?***  
Let me know if you need more details! **Tag friends & share for barakah!** 🤲

**JazakAllah Khair!** May Allah accept your journey. Ameen. 🕋✨  

*(For Pakistanis: Just replace flight details with Islamabad/Karachi → Jeddah options!)*

For infants: First come from the wheel chair gate. Come to the 1st floor . You’ll see people doing dwaf here . There is a place with green carpet where you may leave infant trolly. Take at escalator at gate 74. It’s your exit and later you may join the dwaf at gate 79 . Go straight and everything will be crystal clear. On your return, come back to gate 79 and take the elevator go to the first floor and take your trolley. You may use the elevator but I’m not sure whether they allow you as elevator is kind of short.
